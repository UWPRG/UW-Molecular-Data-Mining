Phosphorescent OLEDs (PhOLEDs) where the emitting materials are dispersed into a host matrix to avoid the exciton loss caused by the mutual interaction of the emitters, are the best devices when considering the efficiencies. These devices can be manufactured either by the expensive vacuum deposition technique or by the economical methods like spin-coating or inkjet printing. For both processes, careful selection of the host materials is one important factor to affect the efficiencies of the PhOLEDs. Generally, for fabricating PhOLEDs by solution-process, polymeric materials like poly(9-vinylcarbazole) (PVK) and others are used as hosts because of their high triplet energy levels, good solubilities (in organic solvents) and excellent film forming properties, but the inherent problems with the polymeric materials like polydispersity affect the device performance to a large extent making it very difficult to maintain the efficiencies of the devices using materials from different batches of syntheses.'),\n",

Carbazole derivatives are the most and best studied materials as hosts in PhOLEDs and as both hosts and emitters in TADF OLEDs. Functionalization of the carbazole nucleus (the functional part of PVK) to improve its electronic properties has been a topic of research in OLEDs for a long time. 3-, 6- and 9-positions of carbazole nucleus are easily accessible, so, the respective derivatives have been widely studied. Furthermore, host materials based on 3- or 6-substituted carbazole result into an unbalanced charge injection into the emission layer (EML) resulting into decreased device performance. However, host materials having substitutions at 1- and 4-position of carbazole are still much rare and only a little work has been reported mainly as bipolar hosts during the past couple of years. Diphenylamino (DPA)-group is an electron rich functionality that can impart excellent electronic properties to the carbazole system when coupled to it as reported previously for 2- and 3-positions of carbazole.

Both the compounds were highly soluble in common organic solvents, mainly because of the free rotation of the DPA functionality, and high quality thin films were produced when spin-coated from their solutions. These two properties encouraged us to use these materials for solution-processed devices albeit the molecular dimensions of the materials were very short that, generally, is not ideal for solution-process.

The positions of the bands remain almost same in both 1-DPACz and 4-DPACz but the intensities for the second and the third bands are highly different indicating a different extension of the electron wave functions from the carbazole to diphenylamino groups due to the attachment positions of the diphenylamino groups over the carbazole nucleus. Fluorescence emission spectral peaks of 1-DPACz and 4-DPACz appeared around 420 nm. If we compare this value with the fluorescence maximum of carbazole moiety (365 nm), these are considerably red-shifted because of extension of electron wave functions from the carbazole to diphenylamino groups.

Because the emitting layer of phosphorescent OLEDs is a mixture of host and dopant, the overall OLED device performance is determined from dopant as well as host. We have previously reported a modified green phosphorescent dopant, Ir(Si-bppy)2(acac), which is useful to solution-processing. We therefore decided to incorporate Ir(Si-bppy)2(acac) (Iridium(III) bis(2-(biphenyl-3-yl)-5-(trimethylsilyl)pyridinato-N, C4\\u2032) (acetylacetonate)) instead of Ir(mppy)3 to investigate the potential of 4-DPACz as a host.

Considering that charge balance inside the organic layer is one of the parameters that determines the efficiency and also its roll-off, the negative influence of low hole mobility of PVK to the overall charge balance can be more and more severe as the current increases. The high hole mobility of 4-DPACz therefore resulted in suppression of efficiency roll-off when it is adopted as a phosphorescent host. Because PVK is a kind of side-chain polymer where each of the N-ethylcarbazole moieties are merely linked, our current result implies that additional functionalization of 4-diphenylamino substituent to the carbazole ring can drastically increase the hole mobility of the carbazole derivatives, which resulted in increased efficiency and reduced roll-off.'),\n",

The efficiency roll-off was particularly low in case of 4-DPACz. Maximum luminous, power and external quantum efficiencies reaching to 47.9 cd A\\u20131, 25.2 lm W\\u20131, and 14.3%, respectively, were achieved with 4-DPACz as a host and Ir(mppy)3 as a dopant. Additional enhancement of efficiencies of 4-DPACz was verified when incorporating another dopant, Ir(Si-bppy)2(acac), resulting in 59.1 cd A\\u20131, 29.5 lm W\\u20131 and 15.8%. The results of 4-DPACz are the best for solution-processed bilayer green PhOLEDs using small molecular hole-transport type host materials. Considering the excellent results using these model small molecules, work is in progress in utilizing these systems as units to synthesize oligomeric, dendritic, and polymeric host materials.'),\n",
